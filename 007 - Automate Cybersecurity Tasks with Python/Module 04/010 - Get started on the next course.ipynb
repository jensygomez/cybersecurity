    "Congratulations on completing Course 7 of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate: **Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python**! In this part of the program, you learned about writing effective Python code to automate cybersecurity tasks. You started with foundational components of the Python language, including data types, variables, conditional statements, and iterative statements. Then you built on those skills by learning how to incorporate functions into your code and work with string and list data. You also explored modules and libraries, as well as guidelines for improving your code’s readability. Finally, you used your Python skills to import and parse files and to develop algorithms that automate security tasks.\n",
