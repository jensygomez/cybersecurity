    "Security logs are often stored in text files. To analyze the security logs in these files, security analysts have to import and parse these files. Python has some functions that come in handy for these tasks, allowing analysts to efficiently access information from text files. \n",

    "In this lab, you'll practice using functions and other syntax in Python to import and parse text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** *Have you already completed this lab once?* Due to how Coursera handles files, you will need to reset the `login.txt\"` file used in this lab to its original contents if you want to complete this lab more than once. The [File contents reset](#file_contents_reset) section at the end of this notebook contains code that allows you to reset the `login.txt\"` file to its original contents. After you have run the code in that section, you can begin the lab again."
