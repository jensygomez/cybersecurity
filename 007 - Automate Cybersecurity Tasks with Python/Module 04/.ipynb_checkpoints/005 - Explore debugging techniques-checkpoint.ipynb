    "# Explore debugging techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, you examined three types of errors you may encounter while working in Python and explored strategies for debugging these errors. This reading further explores these concepts with additional strategies and examples for debugging Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of errors\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a normal part of developing code in Python to get error messages or find that the code you're running isn't working as you intended. The important thing is that you can figure out how to fix errors when they occur. Understanding the three main types of errors can help. These types include syntax errors, logic errors, and exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **syntax error** is an error that involves invalid usage of a programming language. Syntax errors occur when there is a mistake with the Python syntax itself. Common examples of syntax errors include forgetting a punctuation mark, such as a closing bracket for a list or a colon after a function header.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run code with syntax errors, the output will identify the location of the error with the line number and a portion of the affected code. It also describes the error. Syntax errors often begin with the label \"SyntaxError:\" . Then, this is followed by a description of the error. The description might simply be \"invalid syntax\" . Or if you forget a closing parentheses on a function, the description might be \"unexpected EOF while parsing\". \"EOF\" stands for \"end of file.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code contains a syntax error. Run it and examine its output:"

    "\n",
    "**Note:** You will sometimes encounter the error label \"IndentationError\" instead of \"SyntaxError\". \"IndentationError\" is a subclass of \"SyntaxError\" that occurs when the indentation used with a line of code is not syntactically correct.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, using the wrong logical operator, such as a greater than or equal to sign (>=) instead of greater than sign (>) can result in a logic error. Python will not evaluate a condition as you intended. However, the code is valid, so it will run without an error message.\n",

    "-   \"IndexError\": An index error occurs when you place an index in bracket notation that does not exist in the sequence being referenced. For example, in the list usernames = [\"bmoreno\", \"tshah\", \"elarson\"], the indices are 0, 1, and 2. If you referenced this list with the statement print(usernames[3]), this would result in an index error.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   \"TypeError\": A type error results from using the wrong data type. For example, if you tried to perform a mathematical calculation by adding a string value to an integer, you would get a type error.\n",

    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that if you have multiple errors, the Python interpreter will output error messages one at a time, starting with the first error it encounters. After you fix that error and run the code again, the interpreter will output another message for the next syntax error or exception it encounters.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with syntax errors, the error messages you receive in the output will generally help you fix the error. However, with logic errors and exceptions, additional strategies may be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Debuggers**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, you have been running code in a notebook environment. However, you may write Python code in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is a software application for writing code that provides editing assistance and error correction tools. Many IDEs offer error detection tools in the form of a debugger. A **debugger** is a software tool that helps to locate the source of an error and assess its causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases when you can't find the line of code that is causing the issue, debuggers help you narrow down the source of the error in your program. They do this by working with breakpoints. Breakpoints are markers placed on certain lines of executable code that indicate which sections of code should run when debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some debuggers also have a feature that allows you to check the values stored in variables as they change throughout your code. This is especially helpful for logic errors so that you can locate where variable values have unintentionally changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use print statements**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another debugging strategy is to incorporate temporary print statements that are designed to identify the source of the error. You should strategically incorporate these print statements to print at various locations in the code. You can specify line numbers as well as descriptive text about the location.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you may have code that is intended to add new users to an approved list and then display the approved list. The code should not add users that are already on the approved list. If you analyze the output of this code after you run it, you will realize that there is a logic error:"
