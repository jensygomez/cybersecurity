        "Regular expressions are stored in Python as strings. Then, these strings are used in re module functions to search through other strings. There are many functions in the re module, but you will explore how regular expressions work through **re.findall()**. The **re.findall()** function returns a list of matches to a regular expression. It requires two parameters. The first is the string containing the regular expression pattern, and the second is the string you want to search through.\n",

        "The patterns that comprise a regular expression consist of alphanumeric characters and special symbols. If a regular expression pattern consists only of alphanumeric characters, Python will review the specified string for matches to this pattern and return them. In the following example, the first parameter is a regular expression pattern consisting only of the alphanumeric characters **\"ts\"**. The second parameter, **\"tsnow, tshah, bmoreno\"**, is the string it will search through. You can run the following code to explore what it returns:"
