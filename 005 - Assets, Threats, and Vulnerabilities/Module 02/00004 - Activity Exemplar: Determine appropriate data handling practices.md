Next, review the details of the completed data leak worksheet:

### **Issues**

Many people neglected to keep the confidential information private. The manager should have done a better job keeping track of the internal folder by limiting access to the representative and themselves. The customer also could have done a better job of communicating their plans to share the marketing information before posting it to social media.

### **Review**

NIST SP 800-53 is a resource that's designed to help organizations address data privacy risks. The document defines security controls, describes implementation strategies, and suggests individual control enhancements. AC-6 is a section about access controls that relate to the principle of least privilege.

### **Recommendation(s)**

Based on the suggestion of NIST SP 800-53: AC-6, the data leak might have been avoided with the following controls:

- *Automatically revoke access to information after a period of time.*

- *Regularly audit user privileges.*

### **Justification**

Automating security tasks whenever possible is a good way to reduce the chances of human error. In this case, creating a policy that sets expiration dates for access links might have avoided the leak. Requiring managers to regularly audit who can access their files is another way that information could be kept private.
