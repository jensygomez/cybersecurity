You will be introduced to how organizations determine what assets to protect. You'll learn about the connection between managing risk and classifying assets by exploring the unique challenge of securing physical and digital assets. You'll also be introduced to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework standards, guidelines, and best practices for managing cybersecurity risk.

### **Module 2: Protect organizational assets**

![Five icons show the course followed by the four modules sequentially from left to right with module 2 highlighted.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/lZ8MS7o6Q1uRIV-Ib4SO1g_55a2992cc0084c399d1988fe251c21f1_41g2_0VrUyj0cOmP539egHboeQuLVbD-2ZJCVJF4mCiEpjMCxqzQHDievDLfJ-EdQvntYTR48CdQAIuQ0cmTTYIXSnRhWd4NovdXZR7dTIHgN6c44Yr_yfpjnRiCB_XUs07Dje7IimWhuGPFQ6pTrAQ?expiry=1705363200000&hmac=Vw69i0JBX8_F6PPZd6DkgRyQLeTjVrCuntDwN8aWCwA)
