    "\n",
    "Each course of this certificate program is broken into modules. You can complete courses at your own pace, but the module breakdowns are designed to help you finish the entire Google Cybersecurity Certificate in about six months.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s to come? Here’s a quick overview of the skills you’ll learn in each module of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Module 1: Introduction to detection and incident response\n",
    "\n",
    "![Five icons show the course followed by the four modules sequentially from left to right with module 1 highlighted.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/ITeg5fUrSgO-RfEO25rXiw_6b661962d9744550a86a6e25f098dcf1_Sound-R-115-1.png?expiry=1708387200000&hmac=EQtLxiROJcxapr1K4ss6gU71XwgHqcRivhy_FyoxvcE)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be introduced to detection and incident response, and the steps involved in the incident response process. You'll also explore how cybersecurity professionals verify and respond to malicious threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Module 2: Network monitoring and analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "![Five icons show the course followed by the four modules sequentially from left to right with module 2 highlighted.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/PYlRQiYnQHqcsJJIREjglQ_03e4585d1cd64f84ac8e51f98f4472f1_Sound-R-115-2.png?expiry=1708387200000&hmac=L_0LFAoY-6hSzofCWhS6fYiASvp--aweVp7s4y6ephY)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn the importance of network monitoring, and how to understand network traffic. Then, you'll explore how to use network protocol analyzer tools, commonly referred to as packet sniffers. In particular, you'll sniff the network and analyze packets for malicious threats. You'll also craft filtering commands to analyze the contents of captured packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Module 3: Incident investigation and response\n",

    "    \n",
    "-   **Self-review activities** and **labs** give you hands-on practice in applying the skills you are learning and allow you to assess your own work by comparing it to a completed example.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **Interactive plug-ins** encourage you to practice specific tasks and help you integrate knowledge you have gained in the course.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **In-video quizzes** help you check your comprehension as you progress through each video.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **Practice quizzes** allow you to check your understanding of key concepts and provide valuable feedback.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **Graded quizzes** demonstrate your understanding of the main concepts of a course. You must score 80% or higher on each graded quiz to obtain a certificate, and you can take a graded quiz multiple times to achieve a passing score.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for success\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It is strongly recommended that you go through the items in each lesson in the order they appear because new information and concepts build on previous knowledge.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Participate in all learning opportunities to gain as much knowledge and experience as possible.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   If something is confusing, don’t hesitate to replay a video, review a reading, or repeat a self-review activity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Use the additional resources that are referenced in this course. They are designed to support your learning. You can find all of these resources in the [Resources](https://www.coursera.org/learn/detection-and-response/resources/OQmsa) tab.\n",
