    "\n",
    "This activity enabled you to practice applying your documentation skills to complete a journal entry about a ransomware scenario. Accurate and thorough documentation is a critical aspect in incident response because it helps to ensure that important information is not lost or overlooked, and it also allows you to capture aspects of an incident for future use. Continue practicing your documentation skills by creating additional journal entries as you complete the course activities. By the end of the course, you will add this document to your cybersecurity portfolio."
