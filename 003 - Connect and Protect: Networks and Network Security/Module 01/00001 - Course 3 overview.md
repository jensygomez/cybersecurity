## Course 3 content

Each course of this certificate program is broken into modules. You can complete courses at your own pace, but the module breakdowns are designed to help you finish the entire Google Cybersecurity Certificate in about six months.

What’s to come? Here’s a quick overview of the skills you’ll learn in each module of this course.

### **Module 1: Network architecture**

![Five icons show the course followed by the four modules sequentially from left to right with module 1 highlighted.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/36GLUQr7Rz60ZRwJNJObZw_b989febb4ac04369ba9c241ed72881f1_Connect-R-163-1.png?expiry=1705363200000&hmac=U-MoMowvJFt3jdGJIt_9uVxYU67YGpqURFcjNUWvocI)

You'll be introduced to network security and explain how it relates to ongoing security threats and vulnerabilities. You will learn about network architecture and mechanisms to secure a network.

### **Module 2: Network operations**
